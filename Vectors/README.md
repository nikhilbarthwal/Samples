# Vector Algebra system

### Objective

This Libary contains basic vector algebra operations: add , subtract and dot operator. The vector operators are implemented
as C functions which are exposed to python via a C/Python interface.

The library contains a folder lib/ where the C code along with python glue code resides and the src/ folder contains a sample
python source file. The test/ folder contains unit tests for all three vector operations stored in seperate test files.

### Compiling & Executing

Makefile containes all the actions to compile and execute the code. This have been tested on Linux & Mac but NOT Windows.
To execute the code, just use the command:

```
make run
```

The following targets are present in Makefile:

- run: Executed the code. Depends on installing dependencies, type checking, unit testing and compiling the C code.
- Library: Compiles the C code into shared library to be consumed by Python.
- dependencies: installs all the dependencies as mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
- type-check: Type checks the code using pytype. target ensures that the dependencies are installed.
- test: Unit testing of the code
- clean: Removes all artifacts generated by the build process.

---

### Test coverage

In the test/ folder, there are three files which tests the three operators supported.

- add-tests.py: Test the _add_ operator
- sub-tests.py: Test the _sub_ operator
- dot-tests.py: Test the _dot_ operator
